Nernst distribution law states that at constant temperature, when a solute is allowed to distribute between two immiscible solvents in contact with each other, at equilibrium the ratio of the concentration of the solute in two solvent layers is constant. When a solute is shaken in two immiscible liquids, then the solute is found to be distributed between the liquids in a definite manner, if the solute is soluble in each of the solvent. According to distribution law, the distribution co-efficient (kd) at a particular temperature is given by<br>

where C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> represent concentration of solute in water and organic layer respectively. The partition coefficient relates to the same molecular species in each phase i.e. the solute molecules in each solution phase are in the same state of association.<br>

In this experiment, acetic acid will be partitioned between butanol (organic solvent) and water. The concentration of the acid in both the phases will be determined by taking out some small portion and titrating against a standard base using an acid base indicator. One can either use a separating funnel to separate the two phases or carefully pipette out a specific quantity from both the layer of solvents. The concentration of the solvent is varied by adding additional equal quantities of fresh butanol and water and re-distributing the distribution coefficients. In this case, equation (1) will be exactly same where C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are the concentration of acetic acid in water and butanol respectively and hence the partition can be successfully determined.
